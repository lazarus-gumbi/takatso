        <h1>About <span class="green">Takatso Aviation</span></h1>
        <p>Takatso Aviation (Pty) Ltd (“Takatso”) is an investment company established for thesole purpose of acquiring
          controlling stake in South African Airways SOC Limited(“SAA”), in a Strategic Equity Partnership with the
          government of the Republic of SouthAfrica. Takatso is 80% owned by Harith General Partners, the multi fund
          manager andinvestor in infrastructure assets. This investment is a step towards realizing
          Harith’slong-standing interest to establish and grow a transport platform anchored in aviation.It also
          complements Harith’s existing, related assets such as the Lanseria Airport inSouth Africa, the Beitbridge
          border post in Zimbabwe, Traxtion Rail Services inMauritius, amongst others.</p>

        <h1>Why <span class="green">SAA?</span></h1>
        <p>The decision to be a strategic equity partner and to bid for the controlling interest inSAA was a no-brainer
          for us. It fit perfectly with our objective to grow our investmentsin the aviation sector. Harith had
          previously made a bid for Comair, followed by a moveon Mango Airlines (SAA 100%-owned subsidiary). It was
          during these engagementsabout potentially acquiring Mango that it emerged that the seller (government)
          wasinterested only in concluding a deal encompassing the entire SAA group, and not indealing with its
          components in a piecemeal approach. With an illustrious history ofmore than 15 years of undertaking massive
          infrastructure projects and complextransactions across the continent, we were confident we had what it would
          take toreturn SAA to its previous glory in being a safe, reliable and competitive airline in thedomestic,
          regional and international market. And thus Takatso was born.</p>

        <h1>Our Vision with <span class="green">SAA</span></h1>
        <p>The SAA we see post the finalization of the Strategic Equity Partnership processes is agile in a competitive
          market, resilient, commercially viable and sustainable. It contributes to South Africa’s economic growth,
          especially through tourism and other related value-chain sectors. The SAA of the future will not take from the
          tax-payer’s pocket through billions of Rand in bailouts, but will instead add to the kitty in dividends for
          the State, who will hold preference and ordinary shares in SAA. It is a centre of aviation excellence, talent
          and skills growth, and transformation of the industry in line with our country’s equality imperatives</p>
